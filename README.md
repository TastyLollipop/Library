# Library
## The Perfect Way Of Sorting Steam Mods

**What is 'Library'?**
- Library is a free and fast way of sorting your steam mods!
- It will transform your ugly looking steam mod folders into easy to read ones!

**How does it work?**
- The program fetches all the folders of a given path (the one you choose to work on)
- Then it gathers every id of each mod and search for the name of said mod on the internet.
- Finally, it renames the folder to the wanted name.

**How does it look?**
